# computer_vision_series

I am interested in computer vision recently, for it is used by unmanned aerial vehicle and driverless and so on.

Computer vision is also a technology about graphs and data mining algorithms.

For example, k-nearest neighbor algorithm is good for hand-written digits recognition, suport vector machine is helpful to face recognition.

Below are some of my codes about it.
